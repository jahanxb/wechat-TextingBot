Sawyer, you listen to me and you listen hard. 200 people, 200 jobs, $200,000 dollars, five weeks of grind and blood and sweat depend upon you. It's the lives of all these people who have worked with you. You've got to go on, and you have to give and give and give. They've got to like you, they've got to. Do you understand? You can't fall down. You can't, because your future's in it, my future and everything all of us have is staked on you. All right now, I'm through. But you keep your feet on the ground and your head on those shoulders of yours and go out ... and Sawyer, you're going out a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!
Oh, no. It wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast

"Yes, I'm ready now."
"Then close your eyes and tap your heels together three times. And think to yourself, 'There's no place like home'. 'There's no place like home'."
"There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home..."
"Now on the St. Louis team, we have Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know's on third."
